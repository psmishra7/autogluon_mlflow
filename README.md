# autogluon_mlflow
Notebook for autogluon + mlflow params

Note
- root_notebook is the main notebook with illustrative codes
- I haven't added the requirements.txt but the libs are limited (under cell #1 of the notebook)
- I deleted the pickle files from model_out/ directory, but if you run the notebook, you can get the models out (it would take around 1-2gb of space)
